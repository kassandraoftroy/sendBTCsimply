			<p><strong>BTCtx is a wallet agnostic, free and open source webpage that helps anyone publish transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain securely and independently. If you have Bitcoin in an address/private key pair you can move any or all of it with BTCtx. </strong> Most bitcoin users depend on their specific wallet client which could enforce limited transaction possibilities, no control over miner fees, and their own extra fees. Some wallets even manage or store users' private keys which means you have to trust their honesty (they won't take your money) and their security (they won't get hacked or leak your keys). Cold Storage wallets (paper/brain wallets) are the most common way to securely store Bitcoin independently, but they have had the impractical problem of needing to be swept or imported into one of these wallet services if you want to spend or transfer even a partial amount of the coins stuck in cold storage. With BTCtx YOU take full control of your transactions and your security. Cold Storage wallets can act as spending wallets. You control all details of your transactions. Your private keys never even touch a webpage or any application (see our guide for secure offline signing from the shell). This site is completely interoperable with other wallets or transaction tools.
